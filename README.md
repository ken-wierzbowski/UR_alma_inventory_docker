# Setup
For production use this application should be deployed into your institution's PHP web server environment. The Dockerfiles in this repository will demonstrate how to deploy this application using PHP. The Dockerfiles are useful for testing out the application but are not intended for production use.

1. Install Docker if not already installed: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop 

2. Clone the Repo

3. Add Alma key with Prod read-only access to Bibs and Configuration: https://www.screencast.com/t/x2RK4R5JaMwh to the key.php file in the root of the cloned directory: https://www.screencast.com/t/0ZQvml3NAjrk

4. Run "docker-compose up" in project home directory

5. Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser and you should be able to see your list of libraries in the drop down list.

6. Customize index.php to your institutions specifications:
For the index.php file you will also want to modify Change id="itemType" selections to meet your needs (corresponds to material type choices you have enabled in Alma) Change id="policy" selections to meet your needs (corresponds to item policy types defined in Alma)

The docker config for this installation was based off of these instructions: https://bitpress.io/simple-approach-using-docker-with-php/
